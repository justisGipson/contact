As of right now you need to have mongodb-community previously installed. And I only know that the service can be started with Homebrew using: 'brew services start mongo-community' to initiate the mongo server. I'll try to figure out other ways to work around this in the future.

To install:  npm i -g contact-book

To find all available commands: contact-book -h | --help
